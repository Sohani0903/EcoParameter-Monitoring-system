# EcoParameter-Monitoring-system
The Eco-Parameter Monitoring System is an automated environmental monitoring and irrigation control system designed to support efficient and sustainable plant growth. The system continuosly monitors key soil and environmental parameters, including soil moisture, temperature, TDS, and electrical conductivity. Soil moisture sensing plays a critical role in this system. Based on real-time soil moisture data the system automatically controlss water supply to the plants. The Eco-Parameter monitoring system promotes smart agriculture by improving water management.
